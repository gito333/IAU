u) How many processes does this program generate? What are the parent-child relationships between them?
v) What do statements A and B do? How many and which processes do these statements affect?
w) Which processes write to pipe_datos? Which processes read from pipe_datos? Which processes write to pipe_pid?
 Which processes read from pipe_pid?
x) Note that statement D causes the last child N-1 to start its execution by invoking function f1.
   Which processes send the SIGUSR1 signal? Towards which processes are they directed? How many SIGUSR1 
    signals are sent in total?
y) Which process writes first to pipe_pid? What data does it write? Which process reads that data?
z) Note that the variable pid_aux is global. It is assigned in function f1 and used in function f2.
   After processing the last SIGUSR1 signal, what data does the variable pid_aux of each child process contain?
aa) Which processes send the SIGUSR2 signal? Towards which processes are they directed? How many SIGUSR2 signals are sent in total?
ab) Which process sends the first signal? And the last signal?
ac) Just before the parent process terminates, what data does the pipe_pid file contain? (Note: "fichero de pipe_pid" translates literally to "pipe_pid file", referring to the pipe itself)
ad) What sequence of characters does the parent process read in the final loop (statement C)?
