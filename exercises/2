Goal: Write a program that creates two processes: a producer and a consumer.
Producer Task: Opens the file /tmp/datos.txt and reads the characters stored in it.
Consumer Task: Calculates and prints to standard output the number of characters stored in that file, without reading the file directly.
Communication: Communication between the two processes must use a pipe.
Parent Task: The parent process must abort the execution of both child processes (producer and consumer)
  if they have not finished their execution after 60 seconds have passed.
